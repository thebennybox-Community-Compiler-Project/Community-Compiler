# External Declarations
External Declarations are used to call unmanaged or native functions from e.g. ``c`` or ``c++``.

## External Modifier
A function can be marked with ``extern`` to tell the compiler that the function is external. In this case the function body is replaced by a semicolon.
```
extern fn printf(out: str);
```

## External Block
``extern`` can also be used to create block in which external functions can be defined. Only function heads can be defined in this body and the ``extern`` modifier applies to every function.
```
extern {
  fn printf(out: str);
  fn sqrt(num: f64): f64;
}
```
