# Comments
Comments are used to explain code and are ignored by the compiler. Should a comment be inside a string literal it is parsed as a string instead of a comment.

## Single-Line Comments
Single-line comments start with ``//`` and only end after a new line (``\n``).
```
some_code(); //This is a comment
"//this isn't a comment"
```

## Multi-Line Comments
Multi-line comments start with ``/*`` and end with ``*/``.

```
/*
multi
line
comment
*/

"/* not a comment */"


/*
/*

comments can't be interleaved

*/
*/ -> syntax error, "*/" is an unknown expression
```
